# Validate the GitHub Actions workflow files locally.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Nothing else in the repo ever PARSES .github/workflows/*.yml. The release
#   regressions grep release.yml for fixed strings, which succeeds happily on a
#   file GitHub cannot load at all, and ci-local.sh re-implements the job order
#   in bash from a comment header rather than reading ci.yml. So a workflow
#   could be syntactically invalid -- the whole matrix refusing to start with
#   "Invalid workflow file" -- while every local gate reported green. That is
#   exactly what happened: an unquoted job `name:` containing ": " parsed as a
#   nested mapping and took the entire CI run down, after a full clean
#   ci-local.sh pass.
#
#   These checks are deliberately cheap and structural. They do not emulate the
#   Actions runner; they assert the file is loadable and internally consistent,
#   which is the class of failure a local run can otherwise never see.
#
# TOOL POLICY
#   Needs PyYAML. Absent, this SKIPS cleanly by default (so a bare checkout can
#   still run `make test`) but FAILS under STRICT_TOOLS=1 -- which is what
#   ci-local.sh sets, so the gate that exists to mirror CI can never quietly
#   validate nothing.
